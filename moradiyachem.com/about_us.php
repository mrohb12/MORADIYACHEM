        <h4>Research & Development</h4>
        <p class="in"> Moradiya Chemicals has been concentrating on Research and Development and has scaled up its investments to step-up its capabilities in research. Moradiya Chemicals R&D activities can be categorized as follows:
        <h5>
          <p class="in"> 1. Research Intermediate development for both small and large molecules for in-house applications 
        </h5>
        <p class="innn"> •  Moradiya Chemical’s Intermediate development meets the speed and quality requirements, as all the elements of research have been conducted at Mahad </p>
        <p class="innn"> •  Backward integration by in-house intermediate development to efficient Marketing/ Distribution of products. </p>
        <h5>
          <p class="in"> 2. Process Research & Development 
        </h5>
        <p class="innn"> •  In present pharmaceutical challenging environment, the process research & development chemistry requires being sharp in the industrial-scale chemistry research by not only developing the cost effective processes but also ensuring that processes are protected by Intellectual Property Rights. </p>
        <p class="innn">•  Moradiya Chemicals Process Research & Development will shape on the basic techniques of process engineering and introduce on-line analyzing and control method to yield capabilities for current process development and scale-up together with the creation of very excellent robust commercial scale routes. </p>
        <p class="innn">•  Moradiya Chemicals R&D laboratory is fully equipped for kilogram scale preparation of API intermediates. </p>
        <p class="innn">•  We have the technology for short path distillation technique by heat sensitive chemicals can be distilled efficiently. It  is usually performed under high vacuum at presser less than 0.001 bar. </p>
        <p class="innn">•  Hence it provides lowest distillation temperature and short residence time. Thus reduces possibility of thermal degradation of product </p>
        <h5>
